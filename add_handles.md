# add_handles

Handles script for oaipmh

## Purpose

This script is supposed to add the handles field to items in Fedora
that don't have it. Specifically it takes in the results from the plastron
export command, and creates a new csv file with the handles column so the items
can be updated.

## Developtment Environment
